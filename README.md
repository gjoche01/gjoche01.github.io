This project took me about 4 hours. 
I think my website follows all the standards for the project, but I wish it looked a bit more interesting. I made seperate CSS files for each html file, which I think is ok but I am not quite sure. I discussed this project with Sophie Maki. I got some help from a comp20 TA as well.
