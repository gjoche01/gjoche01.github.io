		Hi! I am a student at Tufts Univerity. I'm passionate about journalism-- thorugh words, audio podcasting, photography, and other multi-media formats. I also love coding and solving challenging problems with computer science. After I graduate, I hope to fuse my interests together and find a job that uses both journalism and computer science.
